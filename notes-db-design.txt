Creating a separate `Enrollment` model as a junction table between `DanceClass` and `Dancer` models offers several advantages over directly connecting `Dancer` to `DanceClass` with an array field. Here are some reasons why this approach is better:

1. **Rich Relationships**:
   - An `Enrollment` model can store additional information about the relationship between a `Dancer` and a `DanceClass`. For instance, it might store the date of enrollment, attendance records, performance grades, or any other relevant information.
   - This provides a rich relationship that can evolve over time as the application's requirements change.

2. **Database Normalization**:
   - Using a junction table like `Enrollment` is a normalized approach that helps maintain data integrity and consistency in many-to-many relationships.
   - It's a common practice in database design, making your schema more understandable and maintainable.

3. **Scalability**:
   - As the number of dancers and classes grows, a separate `Enrollment` model helps to keep the database organized and querying efficient.
   - Direct arrays can become problematic in terms of performance and management in larger datasets.

4. **Ease of Querying**:
   - Itâ€™s easier and more efficient to query, update, or delete relationships through a dedicated `Enrollment` model.
   - Complex queries and joins are more straightforward with this kind of setup.

5. **Extensibility**:
   - If your application evolves to include new features or data points related to a dancer's enrollment in a class, having a separate `Enrollment` model makes it easier to extend the schema.

6. **Data Integrity**:
   - An `Enrollment` model helps ensure data integrity by clearly defining the relationships and potentially setting up cascading deletes or updates.

7. **Consistency**:
   - This approach promotes a consistent way of handling many-to-many relationships throughout your application, which is beneficial for code maintainability and readability.

These advantages make the `Enrollment` model a more robust and flexible choice for managing the many-to-many relationship between dancers and dance classes in your web application.

   save only the filename, not the entire url.  This is becasue you may someday want ot rename the bucket, or migrate the files to anouther file storage service.  You can keeo th filenames on the backend, and only have to change the url on the front end
